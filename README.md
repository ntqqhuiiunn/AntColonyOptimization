## **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**
### One of the applications of ACO is solving TSP, which is a non-polynomial-hard optimization problem. In this case, we consider that a shipping unit needs to transport goods from one big warehouse to smaller warehouses. 
### ***Input***:
#### Set of coordinates of warehouses, including start point, such that the first coordinates is start point
### ***Output***:
#### List of ordering points, called route, such that the shipper needs to follow that route and a .html file shows the map like that:
